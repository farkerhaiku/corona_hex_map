corona_hex_map
==============

I spent a night trying to figure out how to do a corona hex map.  I'm still learning lua so I'm definitely open to any suggested ways to make this better. 

Feel free to make use of this however you'd like!  If you end up using any of it I'd love to hear about it.

TODO:
 - alternate between different drawing strategies (i.e. pointy top hexagons or flat top hexagons)
 - unpassable terrain (e.g. walls) in distance calculations
